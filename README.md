# Digit-Classification-Using-CNN-on-MNIST-with-TensorFlow
This project implements a handwritten digit recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset. However, the primary focus is on exploring the security vulnerabilities of AI models by simulating adversarial attacks through image distortion techniques.
